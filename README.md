## D277 â€“ FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPMENT

As part of a static webpage project, my goal was to develop an engaging and functional website focused on a specific state, highlighting multiple cities within that state. Each city featured unique facts and details to provide users with an informative and interactive experience.

**Technologies and Features Used:**

- **HTML & CSS**: Built the foundational structure and style of the site, ensuring a clean and visually appealing design.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented media queries to create a fully responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices.
- **JavaScript**:
  - Used event listeners for client-side validation, allowing users to verify their input before submission.
  - Implemented basic form validation to ensure that user input matches specific criteria.
- **Session Storage**: Utilized `sessionStorage` to temporarily store and manage user input, allowing for practice in handling client-side data storage without server dependency.

This project allowed me to enhance my front-end development skills, particularly in responsive design, form validation, and temporary data storage.
